Months ago during the covid lockdown, I was watching a youtube video, which was about some IMO question back in 2011. The question was about a rotating mill that rotates around its pivot, the challenging part was the idea that when the mill meets another pivot, the pivot switches to a newly met one. The next rotation was tricky and sometimes it is hard to imagine the next mill position whether the rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise. The imagination gets harder when you want to predict more than on pivot changes.

However, the thing is it gets easier when you start to imagine more and more. Yes, after a while it is easy to guess what will happen you can easily imagine what will happen in the next moves. Every single new pivot change turns to exactly the same problem and it needs the same effort to guess the next move.

I was thinking about making a game based on this idea and the challenge could be guessing the next moves, Therefore I came with the game called "Windmill Puzzles". In the game it is simple and sometimes very challenging to find the starting pivot and mill angle which would form the provided order.

I designed a simple algorithm by which the order would be calculated and I was able to generate puzzle labels based on it. Sometimes I drew and design levels on paper and then added them to the game. Another mode which was creating pivot at the appropriate position is added but it is not included in first release. Finally, I finished up with 48 levels. It was fun and challenging and at the same time a compulse for me to finish what i started.

As a side project, it took about 3 months to be developed.Most of the time was being spend on creating a puzzle and In this period all the idea, art, and level design, developing and testing was done.   

Hopefully, in the next days after some final changes and optimizations, I will publish it on google play.
