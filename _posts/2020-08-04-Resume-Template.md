Today I was searching for some resume template and couldn't find any thing appropriate to update my resume. Searching in the pages, I suddenly found some familiar website [overleaf CV templates](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv) that was offering bunch of cool and featured resume templates.
Overleaf has a rich text-editor, that you can see the output of your tex input immediately in result pan! You can crete a new template with help of "use as template" feature and start your personal content
right away.\
After spending minutes i found [Modern CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/modern-cv-and-cover-letter-2015-version/sttkgjcysttn), a solid one that fit my needs. It is simple and at the same time somehow modern! with many color options. Well thanks to it's creator.
